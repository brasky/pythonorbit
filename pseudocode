#Here is the pseudo code for the logic described this morning


Call tickers (all coins all data)

lists we will have:

BNBcoins = []
ETHcoins = []
BTCcoins = []
firstData = []
secondData = []
thirdData = []
###########################



for allcoins in tickers

#organize lists of each type we will deal with
    if it's a BNB coin (not BNBBTC or BNBUSDT):
        create a list of these coins called "BNBcoins"
    if it's an ETH coin (not ETHBTC or ETHUSDT):
        create a list of these coins called "ETHcoins"
    if it's an BTC coin (not ETHBTC or BNBBTC or anything with USDT):
        create a list of these coins called "BTCcoins"
  #define the price/depth of the third step
    if the symbol == ETHBTC:
        define the price/depth of ETHBTC
    if the symbol == BNBBTC:
        define the price/depth of BNBBTC
        
        
# now all calculations are done using those lists, instead of using the tickers

#first step is to buy shitcoin
for btccoins in BTCcoins:
  calculate how many you could buy given the ask price
  firstBalance = {
  symbol,

  max throughput
  }
